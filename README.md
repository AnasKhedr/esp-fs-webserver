From FSBrowser.ino example to an Arduino library

FSBrowser.ino is one of the best examples to start with, when you want to make a small webserver with ESP32 or ESP8266. 
Unfortunately it is a rather complex example for a novice. 
This library makes it easier by incorporating the many functions of example into a specific class.


## ACE web broswer editor
Thanks to the built-in **/edit** page (enabled by default), is possible upload, delete and edit HTML/CSS/JavaScript source files directly from browser and immediately displaying the changes introduced at runtime without having to recompile the device firmware.

## WiFi manager
I've added also another built-in page **/setup**, also enabled by default, with which it is possible to set the WiFi credentials and other freely configurable parameters.
